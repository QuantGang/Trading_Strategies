# 📈 Python Trading Strategies  

## 🧐 What is this repository?  
This repository contains a collection of **quantitative trading strategies** implemented in **Python**. It focuses on **backtesting, optimization, and real-time execution** of strategies across multiple asset classes, including **equities, forex, and derivatives**. The goal is to develop, test, and refine **data-driven** trading models that leverage statistical, machine learning, and algorithmic approaches.

## 🔍 Why this project?  
- To **research and develop** systematic trading strategies.  
- To **evaluate** strategy performance using **robust backtesting frameworks**.  
- To **optimize** trading algorithms for better risk-adjusted returns.  
- To **automate trading** decisions with real-time market data.  
- To **experiment** with advanced techniques like **machine learning, reinforcement learning, and stochastic modeling** in trading.  

## ⚙️ How does it work?  
1. **Strategy Design**: Define the rules and logic of a trading strategy (e.g., momentum, mean reversion, statistical arbitrage).  
2. **Data Ingestion**: Fetch market data from sources like **Yahoo Finance, Binance API, Interactive Brokers, Quandl, or Alpha Vantage**.  
3. **Backtesting**: Use **Backtrader, Zipline, or custom frameworks** to evaluate performance on historical data.  
4. **Risk Management**: Implement position sizing, stop-loss, and drawdown limits to control risk.  
5. **Optimization**: Tune parameters using **grid search, Bayesian optimization, or reinforcement learning**.  
6. **Execution**: Integrate with brokers (IBKR, Alpaca, Binance) for live or paper trading.
